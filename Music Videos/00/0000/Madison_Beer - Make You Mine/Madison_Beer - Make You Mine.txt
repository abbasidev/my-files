[Chorus]
I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine

[Verse 1]
Step inside my mind, you can see the shrine
Got you on my walls, believe it (Believe it)
Baby, don't be scared, want you everywhere
Catch you if you fall, I mean it (I mean it)

[Refrain]
Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine

[Chorus]
I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
Make you mine

[Post-Chorus]
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine

[Verse 2]
See it in my eyes, how they never lie
Just a little bite, are you dreamin'? (Are you dreamin'?)
Now I got you up, would you look at us?
Fantasy to life, and I'm screamin', screamin'

[Refrain]
Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine

[Chorus]
I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I, lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
Make you mine

[Post-Chorus]
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine
