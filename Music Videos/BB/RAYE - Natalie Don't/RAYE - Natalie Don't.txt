[Verse 1]
It's been twenty-four hours
Coulda bought me flowers
You know I ain't been happy (Nuh-uh)
Maybe call me in an hour
Do you wish that it was her though
Singing songs in the shower?
Baby, no, I can't help it (Nuh-uh)
Reassure me about her

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you staring at him, I can see
When you know he belongs to me
You know I miss him at sunrise
Behind his eyes, he is thinking of you

[Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't
Oh no, there she goes
To take him from my hand
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't (Mmm)

[Verse 2]
He saw it
Saw her walk in like a model (Uh)
But I won't let it depress me (Nuh-uh)
So I bought another bottle (Uh)
Why you bend over like that? (Uh, yeah)
Can't you see my sorrow? (Uh, yeah)
When you bend over like that (Uh, yeah)
You know his eyes gon' follow, oh (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you staring at him, I can see
When you know he belongs to me
You know I miss him at sunrise
Behind his eyes, he is thinking of you

[Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't
Oh no, there she goes
To take him from my hand
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't (Mmm)
Don't, don't, don't, don't

[Bridge]
Why am I still awake at six in the morning?
Oh, I know you call him
Natalie, please feel bad
Don't text back, leave my man
Like Dolly begged Jolene
Just 'cause you can, don't take him please (Please, please, please)

[Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't (Don't do it to me, Natalie, don't)
Oh no, there she goes
To take him from my hand
I'm begging her, not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't do it

[Outro]
Don't, don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
(Natalie don't) Don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't do it
