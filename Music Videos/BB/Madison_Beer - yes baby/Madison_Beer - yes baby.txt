[Verse 1]
Speakin' to me soft like silky sheets
Figures in the dark, two heartbeats
Basically a God, you pray to me
Whisper in the dark, you want me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a look (It's a look), it's a touch (It's a touch)
It's a dangerous kind of crush
Say it once (Say it once), say it twice (Say it twice)
Come and say it another time
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes (Ah)

[Chorus]
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Yes, baby, yes)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Yes, baby, yеs)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yеs, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (So put the work in, cut your teeth)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Don't you wanna hear me say?)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (It's the least you could do for me)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (I just wanna hear you say)

[Post-Chorus]
Yes, baby
Yes, baby
Yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes

[Verse 2]
Something in the way you're watchin' me
Talkin' to me nice and slowly (Slowly)
Promise if you ask, you will receive
Come a little closer to me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a look (It's a look), it's a touch (It's a touch)
It's a dangerous kind of crush
Say it once (Say it once), say it twice (Say it twice)
Come and say it another time
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes (Ah)

[Chorus]
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Yes, baby, yes)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Yes, baby, yes)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (So put the work in, cut your teeth)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (Don't you wanna hear me say?)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (It's the least you could do for me)
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby (I just wanna hear you say)

[Post Chorus]
Yes, baby
Yes, baby
Yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes

[Chorus]
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby
Yes, baby, yes, yes, baby, yes, yes, baby

[Outro]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
