[Chorus]
Boy, let me know if this is careless, I
Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide
Which one is leading me to hell or paradise?
Baby, I can’t hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type
I'm the jealous type

[Verse 1]
He loves me
But he can’t hold this above me
When my eyes are green, I'm ugly
You're vain and hip to rushing
I'm so overtired
I will not wait in this lane
Never seen you cry
You're mine

[Chorus]
Boy, let me know if this is careless, I (Let me know)
Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide (Just can't decide)
Which one is leading me to hell or paradise? (Oh)
Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I’m the jealous type
I’m the jealous type

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I’m jealous
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I’m jealous
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type

[Verse 2]
I said, "You wanna do what now with who?"
I don't need a pin-drop or a text tonight
I ain't even coming out with you
You don't wanna show me off to your ex or your friends tonight
Nigga, you must be on molly
'Cause y'all ain't kick it when we started up
And if she really was a friend like you said she was
I would've been locked in, but I called your bluff, ha
No girl enjoys trying to tough it out for a party boy
Everyone wants you and you love all the noise
You want what you can't have, but I made a choice
I'm not your toy (Boy, let me know)

[Chorus]
Boy, let me know if this is careless, I
Could be torn between two roads that I just can't decide (I can't decide)
Which one is leading me to hell or paradise?
Baby, I can't hurt you, sure, but I'm the jealous type
I'm the jealous type

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I'm jealous
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, yeah, I'm jealous
Oh, I'm jealous, baby, I'm the jealous type
