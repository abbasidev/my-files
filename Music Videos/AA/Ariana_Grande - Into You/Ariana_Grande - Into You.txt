[Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's risin' in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waitin' and waitin' for you to make a move (Ooh)
Before I make a move (Ooh)

[Chorus]
So baby, come light me up
And baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, yeah
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right
Right, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's risin' in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waitin' and waitin' for you to make a move (Ooh)
Before I make a move (Ooh)

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up
And baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us
So baby, let's keep it secret (Mm)
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you ('Cause I'm so into you)

[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge of no control
And I need, I need you to know, you to know
Oh-woah, yeah

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up (Light me up)
And baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (Little dangerous)
But baby, that's how I want it (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (No, ayy)
Got everyone watchin' us (Watchin' us)
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous (Scandalous)
But baby, don't let them see it (Yeah)
A little less conversation (Yeah) and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (Ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
So, come light me up
So, come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (I'm so into you)
