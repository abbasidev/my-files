[Verse 1]
I see the panic somewhere in your eyes
Yeah, in your eyes
Our wildest habits brought us here tonight
Yeah, back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're gonna leave me hangin'
Then you're gonna leave me dead
I'm never goin' home
If you're not there

[Chorus]
I wanna give into your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done? (Oh)
I wanna give into your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done?

[Verse 2]
I wanna taste the secrets that you hide
And make 'em mine (Ah)
Come take me to the edge of afterlife
And take your time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're gonna leave me hangin'
Then you're gonna leave me dead
Oh, I'm never goin' home
If you're not there (Oh)

[Chorus]
I wanna give into your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done? (Ooh)
I wanna give into your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done? (Oh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
When the dancing's done
When the dancing's done
