[Verse 1]
Once you see my black mascara
Run from you into my mama's hands
You selfish man
You'd understand (Understand what you)
Once you see my slick eyeliner
Blend into my black designer bags under my eyes
Oh, how'd you try to understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
What you done to me
What you done to me
What you

[Chorus]
Done to me
You done to me?
You done to me?
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You made your bed (Made your bed)
Lied your lies (Lied your lies)
And fucked my mind up
Try to understand just what you
Done to me
You done to me?
You done to me?
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You made your bed (Made your bed)
Lied your lies (Lied your lies)
And fucked my mind up
Try to understand just what you

[Verse 2]
Now you see my black mascara
Run from you into my mama's hands
You selfish man (Do you understand)
How it feels?
And what you've done?

[Chorus]
Done to me
You done to me?
You done to me?
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You're done to me
You made your bed (Made your bed)
Lied your lies (Lied your lies)
And fucked my mind up
Try to understand just what you

[Post-Chorus]
(Try to understand just what you)
(Fucked my mind up, fucked my mind up, fucked my mind up)
(Try to understand just what you)
(Try to understand just what you)
Understand
Do you understand?

[Verse 3]
Tripped on the throttle
Sipped on bottle, serious
Tell them hoes to be minding they business
Heart broke but I'm still looking like millions
Six shots down so I can't feel this
Talking my ear off, cocaine
Got a bitch gassed up, propane
Now I can't come down, or it pours
Oh, underneath my eyes, how it rains
There's clouds up high
But there's stars on the ceiling of the Royce
I hear this pain, drown every other noise
You talk to me dumb like you didn't have a choice
I'm here now fucked up, thinking this why
I'm out here sinking in these dark nights
Nights, ah, yeah

[Bridge]
Look what you've done to me
You've done to me, my baby
Look what you've done to me
You've done to me, my lover
Just what you've done to me
You've done to me
You've done to me
You've done to me
You've done to me
You've done
Try to understand just what you

[Outro]
Try to understand just what you
Do you, oh, do you understand how it feels?
Try to understand just what you
Look what you've done to me
You've done to me, my baby
Try to understand just what you
Do you, oh, do you understand how it feels and what you've done?
What you've done
