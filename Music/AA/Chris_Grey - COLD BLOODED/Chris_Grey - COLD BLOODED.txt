[Verse 1]
Underneath her love there's a blade
Lost inside her mind it's a maze she's a
Disaster I can't look away but she's
All mine, all mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I should run, I should be terrified
Turn to stone if you look in her eyes
She won't stop until she's satisfied

[Chorus]
She's got her venom in my veins, liquor on her lips
Driving me insane, but she knows I can't resist
Digging in her fangs, feels just like a kiss
She don't need nobody, she my cold-blooded bitch
Her love is a drug, I'm addicted to hеr lies
If I take too much, I won't make it out alivе
Poison in her touch, I crave it on my skin
She don't need nobody, she my cold-blooded bitch

[Verse 2]
Underneath her gaze I still fall
In love with the thrill of it all but then
When she leaves I'm in withdrawal, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I should run, I should be terrified
Turn to stone if you look in her eyes
She won't stop until she's satisfied

[Chorus]
She's got her venom in my veins, liquor on her lips
Driving me insane, but she knows I can't resist
Digging in her fangs, feels just like a kiss
She don't need nobody, she my cold-blooded bitch
Her love is a drug, I'm addicted to her lies
If I take too much, I won't make it out alive
Poison in her touch, I crave it on my skin
She don't need nobody, she my cold-blooded bitch

[Outro]
Oh, she's wrapped around my body, gripping tight
She looks like temptation that I can't fight
She lives for the pleasure and the pain
Tried my best but I can't keep away
My heart's inside her hands, I feel her squeezing
I'll follow her as long as I'm breathing
I know that she wouldn't do the same
But I'll follow her to the grave
